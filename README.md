- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheComputerCrusader
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in various different technology topics, including: **Linux, Cloud Computing, Open-Source Software** and **Hardware,** and much more!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning networking at a community college.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me with my business email, **thecomputercrusader@gmail.com**

All of those topics I mentioned above I cover on my YouTube ðŸ“¹ channel, which you can find right here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmGAuF29fFFneFyOF-bszQQ

I'm currently working on creating a fully-featured website for my "brand," I guess you would call it.
